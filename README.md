# BluetoothCar
Bluetooth controlled RC car with video based on the ESP32-Cam. The video isn't the best since its over Bluetooth but it's not bad.

# Android App
There is a [App](https://github.com/bradylangdale/BluetoothCarApp) that goes along with this Arduino code. It'll display the video and send button presses.

# GUI
There is also a [GUI](https://github.com/bradylangdale/BluetoothCarGUI/) that goes along with this Arduino code. It'll display the video and take inputs.
